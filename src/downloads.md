Riff is currently in alpha/design phase. For now, you can clone
the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/riff-lang/riff) and
follow the instructions provided in the `README` to install `riff` on
your machine. In the future, a download link with installation
instructions will be provided here.

If you're already using Riff, you might be interested in the [Vim
plugin](https://github.com/riff-lang/vim-riff), which offers full
syntax highlighting for Riff files in Vim.
